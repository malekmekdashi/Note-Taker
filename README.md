  ## Description
  This week's homework assignement requires us to use Express.js to build an application to ultimately deploy it on Heroku. The objective of this application is to allow the user to create a title and jot down a note. When we first deploy the application without touching it, we are faced with only one html file, and it is our job to link the notes html when we click to create notes. We are also faced with the issue of not being able to save the notes on the page. This is resolvable by using the "get" and "post" method. After everything is done, it is our job to deploy this application using Heroku.
